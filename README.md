# RNN
Since deep learning's evolution  the RNN is taking over others algorithms  because of his capability to remember previous events .
It uses in many areas of Artificial Intelligence such in NLP field (Natural Language Processing) and also works really well on temporal data because the complexity of those datas based times so dealing with those data we then need to consider the previous events before the currents ones this kinda task is very difficult one so how we can tackle those problems ? 
RNN is the best deep learning's best algorithm to deal with with this specific task
To see the power of this algorithm we used the Google Stock Price to see how the evolution of the stock accross the time (date) and how the evolution can be affected !
